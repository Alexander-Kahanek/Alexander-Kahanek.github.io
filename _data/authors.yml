    I am originally from the small city of Gardner, Massachusetts, which is home to the largest chair. After highschool I promptly joined the US Army National Guard as a Healthcare Specialist (68W),
    which after spending 7 years in the military, as well as 4 years as an EMT, I have recently started a new path towards Data Science. While this is a drastic change, there are a few things that
    correlate with my time in the military and medical fields, which helps give me a different perspective on ideas. However, since pursuing this goal of Data Science I have learned that I love problem solving, and even more so are problems that involve Mathematics.
    This is why I have fully switched into pursuing the Data Science industry, and I aspire to be on the forefront developing algorithms in all aspects of Artificial Intelligence. Although I am a long way away from that goal, I strive
    to learn as much as I can in all aspects of the Data Cycle.

    There are quite a few things I am passionate about in life, and Data Science is just one facet of my life. My favorite friend is a 
    little Corgi named Link. Link came into my life when he was only eight weeks old, and by the time he was twelve weeks old I had taught him how to skateboard. I also
    enjoy doing leather-working in my spare time, making anything from wallets to backpacks.
