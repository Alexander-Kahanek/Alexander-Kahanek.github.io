5. Open <http://localhost:4000/>

### GitHub Pages
1. Fork this repository.
2. Go to **Settings**, rename repository to `<your github username>.github.io` (without the `<` `>`)
3. Edit `_config.yml` (you can do this directly on GitHub)
    1. Change `url` to `https://<your github username>.github.io` (without the `<` `>`)
    2. Change `baseurl` to `''` (empty string)
    3. **Commit changes**.
