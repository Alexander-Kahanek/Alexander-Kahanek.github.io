&nbsp; &nbsp; _Data Visualization_ `October 1, 2020`
: > I collaborated with <a href="https://www.rubbish.love/" title="Rubbish Website" target="_blank">_Rubbish, co._</a> to visualize their community-led trash cleanup of SoMa West, CA, which contained over 25,000 points of litter and issues collected! This data dashboard was created using R Shiny and Python, and the dataset can even be downloaded for free!

&nbsp; &nbsp; _Machine Learning, Classification_ `April 30, 2020`

: > Using Trivago's hotel booking data, I walk you through an in-depth feature analysis to find important fields that could be used to improve customer retention. I walk through the implementation of the three presented models for predicting whether a customer will cancel their booking prior to arrival, each with their own benefits of reducing incorrectly predicted cancelations (False Negative Rate) and improving the correctly guessed cancelations (True Positive Rate).

<!-- : > This project uses hotel booking data from Trivago, the project is focused on predicting whether a booking will potentially be canceled or retained through the use of creating multiple models with Random Forest, as well as an Exploratory Data Analysis. This is done to gain better insight into bookings, as well as to gain a market advantage through the potential use of targeted advertising with the help of Machine Learning. -->

&nbsp; &nbsp; _Predictive Analysis_ `March 24, 2020`
: > I walk you through the full process of manipulating the COVID-19 data, analyzing the data for patterns, and creating and implementing a hand built Markov Chain type Monte Carlo Algorithm to predict the future number of Cumulative Deceased Cases in Italy. The predictions had great accuracy to the actual reported cases, especially as only 2 months of data was used.

<!-- : > This project uses the COVID-19 data to create and implement a hand built Markov Chain type Monte Carlo Algorithm to predict the future number of Cumulative Deceased Cases in Italy, as well as take an in-depth analysis of Italys' Deceased Cases. -->
