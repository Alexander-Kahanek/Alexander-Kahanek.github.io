### Hotel Booking Classification - Random Forest

> This project uses hotel booking data from Trivago, the project is focused on doing a small analysis on the data, as well as creating multiple models with Random Forest to predict whether a booking will potentially be canceled or retained. This is done to gain better insight into bookings, as well as to gain a market advantage through the potential use of targeted advertising with the help of the modeling.
